				<h2>Background</h2>
				<section id="background-ag">
					<h3>Motivation for Accessibility Guidelines 2 Working Group (AG 2 WG)</h3>
					<p>Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, and also benefits older users and people without disabilities. Accessible design improves overall user experience and satisfaction, especially in a variety of situations, and across different devices. It is essential that several different components of web development and interaction work together in order for the web to be accessible to people with disabilities. These components include content technologies, web content, web browsers and media players, assistive technology, users, developers, authoring tools, and evaluation tools. Groups in the Web Accessibility Initiative work together to address accessibility for all the components.</p>
					<p>The Accessibility Guidelines 2 Working Group maintains and enhances the WCAG to specification and support materials which are used as the current baseline for accessibility compliance world wide. WCAG 2 describes support from other components needed for its advice to work, such as technologies, user agents, and authoring tools. Guidelines from this Working Group are widely used by developers and implementers, referenced in industry policy, and benefit all web users.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="background-focus">
					<h3>Focus for the 2022 - 2024 Charter</h3>
					<p>The goal of this 2022 - 2024 AG 2 WG charter will be to create a version of WCAG 2 that actively addresses public issues, updates interpretive guidance, and reduces the redundancy that has occurred during the evolution of WCAG 2.0 to WCAG 2.2. This version will not include new guidance. Instead it will consolidate and supplement existing guidance as well as developing the support materials needed for the updated versions (such as WCAG2ICT).</p>
					<p>At the end of the 2022-2024 charter period, this group will publish the first public working draft (FPWD) of the final version of the WCAG 2.x series. The goal of the following charter period will be to publish that version and close the maintenance of these documents. The associated taskforce work will then move to the AG New WG group.</p>
					<p class="note">If we decide to pursue this direction, the rationale will be added here.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section id="scope" class="scope">
				<h2>Scope</h2>
				<p>The group will create a FPWD final version of WCAG 2 that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>consolidates existing guidance, </li>
					<li>removes redundant language, and </li>
					<li>clarifies the language used. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>This effort will include addressing <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues"><u>open WCAG 2 issues</u></a> and public feedback and updating interpretive support materials for its normative guidance (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/"><u>Understanding WCAG 2</u></a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/"><u>WCAG 2 Techniques</u></a>),</p>
				<p>The group will continue existing work and materials support commitments:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>updates <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/"><u>WCAG2ICT</u></a> with non-normative guidance on applying WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.2 to non-web technology,</li>
					<li>develops Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.1, to keep ACT rules compatible with WCAG 3, and enable writing rules that have proven difficult to write under version 1.0,</li>
					<li>provides evaluation guidance and test materials to support verification of conformance to normative guidance (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/publications">Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.0</a>),</li>
					<li>maintains errata for content developed by predecessor groups (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a>).</li>

						<li>The AG 2 WG 2 is not, and does not aspire to be, the central repository for accessibility support data.</li>
						<li>The AG 2 WG 2 does not perform conformance evaluations and reviews.</li>
						<li>The AG 2 WG 2 does not provide normative guidance on non-web technologies; however, informational guidance may include examples outside the scope of the web.</li>
						<li>The AG 2 WG 2 is not currently working on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines</a> or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines</a>, except to maintain errata.</li>

			<section id="success-criteria">
				<h2>Success Criteria</h2>
				<p> In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
				<p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
				<p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
				<p>There should be sufficient techniques and tests for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts. To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">tests</a>.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="coordination">
				<h2>Coordination</h2>
				<p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes
					occur in a specification following a review.</p>
				<p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

				<h2> Participation </h2>
				<p> To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 15 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementers of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants. </p>
				<p>Key implementers of WCAG (desktop and non-desktop environments) include Web content developers (page authors, site designers, etc.), Web authoring tool developers, Web accessibility evaluation tool developers, user agent tool developers, and people with disabilities.</p>
				<p> The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>. </p>
				<p> The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>. </p>
				<p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

			<section id="communication">
				<h2> Communication </h2>
				<p id="public">Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however. </p>
				<p>Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group home page</a>. </p>
				<p>This group conducts email discussion on the public mailing list <a href="mailto:w3c-wai-gl@w3.org" id="public-name">w3c-wai-gl@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/">archive</a>). <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/">Task forces</a> and sub-groups may use additional lists or other communication mechanisms documented on their home pages. Discussion of issues for specific deliverables generally takes place in the GitHub repository identified for the deliverable. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work. </p>
				<p>The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion. </p>
			</section>
			<section id="decisions">
				<h2> Decision Policy </h2>
				<p>This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
				<p>However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections. </p>
				<p>The Working Group maintains specific procedures to establish and measure consensus and address objections in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/decision-policy">AG Working Group Decision Policy</a>.</p>
				<p>This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires. </p>
